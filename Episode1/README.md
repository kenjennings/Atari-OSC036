Atari BASIC program that scrolls text on the top line of the screen.

In the Atari BASIC program the original C64 BASIC code is included, but commented out with REMarks.  This is usually followed on the next line by the equivalent Atari BASIC commands.   Three file formats are provided: 

**TEXTSCRL.BAS** Tokenized Atari BASIC program.  

**TEXTSCRL.LIS** LIST'ed Atari BASIC program which includes ATASCII End of Line chracters.

**TEXTSCRL.TXT** LIST'ed Atari BASIC program which uses normal unix end of line characters.


The example is also present in OSS BASIC XL with the code cleaned up.   The C64 code is no longer included and the file is renumbered.

**TEXTSCRL.BXL** Tokenized OSS BASIC XL program.  

**TEXTSCRL.LXL** LIST'ed OSS BASIC XL program which includes ATASCII End of Line chracters.

**TEXTSCRL.TXL** LIST'ed OSS BASIC XL program which uses normal unix end of line characters.
