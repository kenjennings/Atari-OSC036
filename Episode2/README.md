# Atari-OSC036 Episode 2
Atari port of OldSkoolCoder's C64 Tutorial 36, Episode 2

---

Assembly language equivalent of the BASIC scrolling program in [**Episode 1**](https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-OSC036/tree/master/Episode1  "**Episode 1**").

***TextScroller.asm*** - The original C64 assembly with modifications for the Atari.  C64-specific code is present and commented out.

***TextScrollerAt8.asm*** - The same as the  "TextScroller.asm" file, but with all the unused C64 code and some useless comments deleted.
