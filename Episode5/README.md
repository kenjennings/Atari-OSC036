# Atari-OSC036 Episode 5
Atari port of OldSkoolCoders C64 Tutorial 36, Episode 5 -  ***WORK IN PROGRESS***

---

Assembly program that implements fine scrolling using the video hardware's fine scrolling feature.

This implements the coarse scrolling the same way as the C64 by rewriting the entire line of screen memory.  On the Atari one would ordinarily use an LMS pointer change to move the screen to display data from a different position -- manipulating a two-byte pointer instead of 40 bytes of screen memory.
