[**Episode 1**](https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-OSC036/tree/master/Episode1 "**Episode 1**") - BASIC program that scrolls the top line of the display.  Of course, this is coarse scrolling a character at a time.

[**Episode 2**](https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-OSC036/tree/master/Episode2 "**Episode 2**") - Assembly language equivalent of the BASIC scrolling program.

[**Episode 3**](https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-OSC036/tree/master/Episode3 "**Episode 3**") - Assembly program that implements fine scrolling by shifting bitmapped images through a character set for the C64, which is essentially nearly identical to the way the Atari works.

[**Episode 4**](https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-OSC036/tree/master/Episode4 "**Episode 4**") - Assembly program that implements fine scrolling by shifting bitmapped images through a character set for the VIC-20.  This is fundamentally the same as the C64 version, but the VIC-20 has a smaller screen geometry.

[**Episode 5**](https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-OSC036/tree/master/Episode5 "**Episode 5**") - Assembly program that implements fine scrolling using the video hardware's fine scrolling feature. ***WIP***
